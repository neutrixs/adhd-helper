Most of us have experienced being in a group conversation where everyone shares their unforgettable moments, yet you're just there saying "Hmm, I don't know, let me think about it." Ironic. Imagine forgetting your unforgettable moments. By the time you have something cool in mind to share with everyone, the topic has changed.

## Why does this happen?
For those with autism spectrum disorder, it's common to have difficulties with autobiographical memory retrieval. It refers to the retrieval of personal experienced memories. Common problems are:

### 1. Less memory specifity
### 2. Less elaborated narratives
### 3. Increased reliance on clues
